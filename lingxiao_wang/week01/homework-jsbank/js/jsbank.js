// JavaScript Bank
//
// In this homework, you'll create a basic bank in Javascript. The bank has many accounts and the following capabilities that you need to write.
//
// Bank
//
// There is only one bank. This bank has an array of accounts. The bank needs a method that will return the total sum of money in the accounts. It also needs an addAccount method that will enroll a new account at the bank and add it to the array of accounts. There is no need to create additional functions of the bank to delete accounts, etc.
//
// The bank has many accounts. Accounts should be objects that all share a set of common functionality.
//
// Accounts
//
// Accounts have a current balance and owner's name. You should be able to deposit or withdraw from an account to change the balance.
//
// There is no need to write a user interface. Make sure functions return values -- you may also have your functions console.log() values to help you see your code working.
//
// You should write a basic story through a series of JavaScript commands that shows that the methods do indeed work as expected: add some accounts, show the total balance, make some deposits and withdrawals, show the new total balance.
